abstract="In this paper, we present a pretopological approach for pattern classification with reject options. The pretopological approach, based on growing $\epsilon$-neighborhoods, already has proved its efficiency in reducing computation time and storage requirements compared to a k-Nearest Neighbors approach. By including ambiguity and distance reject options, we give to such an approach more adaptability to real classification problems for which classes generally are not clearly separable and/or not completely known. In order to control both types of rejection, the proposed classifier needs a unique parameter to be fixed whereas two parameters generally are necessary (one for each reject type). We also have observed that the behavior of the classifier (depending of the parameter value) with respect to both kinds of rejection is similar to the behavior of well-known rejection-based classifiers proposed so far in the literature.",

abstract="The primary end-goal of most medical imaging research program is to collect information about function and physiology of internal human organs or tissues through a variety of in vivo or ex vivo imaging techniques. Often, medical imaging techniques suffer from limited spatial and temporal resolution, noise, background-inhomogeneity, and other artifacts leading to fuzzy representations of target objects in acquired images. Digital topology and geometry play important roles in medical image processing either by expanding the scope of target information or by providing a strong theoretical foundation to a process enhancing its stability, fidelity, and efficiency. The notions of digital topology and geometry are often intertwined in medical imaging applications and sometime it is difficult to draw a dividing line between them. This paper presents recent advancements and overviews of theory and computation of several fuzzy digital topologic and geometric approaches and describe their applications to medical imaging. More specifically, this paper discusses topics related to three-dimensional simple points, local topological parameters, fuzzy skeletonization, characterization of local structures, and their applications to research and clinical studies.",

abstract = "A fuzzy set is a class of objects with a continuum of grades of membership. Such a set is characterized by a membership (characteristic) function which assigns to each object a grade of membership ranging between zero and one. The notions of inclusion, union, intersection, complement, relation, convexity, etc., are extended to such sets, and various properties of these notions in the context of fuzzy sets are established. In particular, a separation theorem for convex fuzzy sets is proved without requiring that the fuzzy sets be disjoint."

We also show that there is no topology compatible with 6-connectedness. We shortly comment on potential further use of this approach.",

Both topologies for Z2 are well known (e.g., one is presented in D. Marcus, F. Wyse et al., Amer. Math. Monthly 77 (1979) 1119, and the second in E. Khalimsky et al., Topology and its Applications 36 (1990) 1) and found applications in computer graphics and computer vision (e.g., A. Rosenfeld, Amer. Math. Monthly 77 (1979) pp. 621, and T.Y. Kong et al., Amer. Math. Monthly 98 (1991) 901). Two of the five topologies for Z3 are products of the topologies known from Z1 and Z2. The remaining three topologies for Z3 are also generated from the two topologies for Z2, however, they are not product topologies."
